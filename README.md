# Diamond Alphabet Generator

This Java program generates a diamond shape using letters, based on the input letter provided by the user. The diamond's size and shape adjust according to the entered letter. The program only accepts a single alphabet letter as input.

### Features:
- **Diamond Shape Generation**: The program generates a symmetric diamond shape based on the provided alphabet letter. The shape starts from 'A' and expands up to the letter entered by the user.
- **Input Validation**: The program ensures that the input is a single valid alphabet letter. If an invalid input is provided, an error message will be shown.

### How It Works:
1. **Input**:
   - The user is prompted to enter a letter. The program only accepts a single letter and converts it to uppercase.
   
2. **Diamond Construction**:
   - The program constructs a 2D array representing the diamond shape. The size of the diamond is determined by the position of the entered letter in the alphabet (e.g., 'A' forms a 1x1 diamond, 'B' forms a 3x3 diamond, etc.).
   
3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the generated diamond pattern to the console, with each row of the array forming a line of the diamond.

### Example:

For example, if the user enters the letter **E**, the program will print the following diamond:

Enter a Letter: E
    A    
   B B   
  C   C  
 D     D 
E       E
 D     D 
  C   C  
   B B   
    A   
### Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The programming language used for the development of this project.
- **Arrays**: The program uses a 2D array to construct and display the diamond shape.

### How to Run:
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   javac DiamondAlphabet.java
